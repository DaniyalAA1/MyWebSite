    <h1>Resources for Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>Professional, approved, and well written textbooks are the best way to learn a topic. You can go in depth on a subject, and learn at your own pace. Using online tutorials from random websites can compromise your learning. They might not be fact checked, trustworthy, or safe to use. Textbooks are a better option. However, videos online can be informative and beneficials to learn from. Below there are 3 textbooks for Computer Science and Programming, and a link to a great YouTube channel that has a playlist of videos on Computer Science. </h2>
